Problem Statement

Potato farmers face substantial economic losses each year due to diseases like Early Blight and Late Blight. These diseases, caused respectively by fungi and microorganisms, require different treatmentsâ€”making accurate early detection critical.
This project aims to solve this problem by developing a deep learning (CNN-based) model that can classify potato leaf images into three categories:
1. Healthy
2. Early Blight
3. Late Blight
By enabling timely and effective disease management, this model can help farmers reduce crop loss and improve productivity.
